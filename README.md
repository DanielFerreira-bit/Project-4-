# Project 4

# Choose Time

  I decided to take a dataset on the Pokémon universe in order to be able to improve my knowledge of this immense universe. I took the dataset from Kaggle.com/datasets .
  
# Data Manipulation Time

 I decided to bring out the data regarding how many talents there are in the universe and how many pokemon have them.
 I decided to bring out and regroup the data concerning the basic statistics of pokemon.
 I decided to bring out the data concerning the number of new pokémons that each new generation brings.
 
 
# The Knowledge used

  In the code, we only see the histogram concerning the contribution of pokémons to each generation.
  
# Some ideas to improve the project

  - Use all the data available in the dataset
  - Have a more complete dataset
  - Different analyzes concerning one single data
